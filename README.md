# Weather-Wizard

This is a simple weather app that displays the current weather in a searched city, as well as a presents 5 day forecast.

# Scope of Work

This is built primarily with JavaScript, bootstrap, and some light CSS styling. I still need to have previous saved searches stored in local history as well as use my own images for weather conditions.
